# Leaks

Here's the thing about gas: it leaks. No matter what you do, it's going to leak. You can replace pipes, you can repair them, you can use the strongest materials, and all the engineering best practices but it's still going to leak.

Richmond currently has over 900 leaks, most of them taking several months to get fixed.

While we can't know the exact amount that's leaking from the system, one estimate we have comes directly from RGW in the form of their Lost and Unaccounted For (LUF) accounting. They calculate this by tallying up all the gas measured at customer meters and subtracting it from amount of gas paid for off transmission pipelines. The difference is what's "lost and unaccounted for". While some of this could be from faulty meters, but it is all lost revenue for RGW, and another cost passed on to RGW customers.

This lost gas has a tremendous cost for Richmond Gas Works ratepayers. Last year alone RGW lost **$15.9 million** in gas, passing the cost directly on to people on their bills. Since 2012 RGW has lost **$47 million** in gas.

Not only is this an extra cost for ratepayers, the principal component in natural gas, is an extremely potent green house gas pollutant. Methane traps around 85 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20 year period, making gas leaks a huge threat to our climate goals. It's so potent that scientists have estimated that total system leaks of more than 3.2% make methane worse for the climate than a coal power plant. This isn't just the leaks in the pipes, this also includes leaks from the well heads, transmission pipes, compressor stations, and behind the meter, such as at your gas stove. Leaks in the distribution system close to or greater than 3.2% mean are disastrous for the climate.

Unfortunately, the LUF shows loss rates much greater than 3.2%, reaching an all-time high in December 2022 at 9.1%.

Looking just at the yearly values we can see a dramatic worsening in lost gas, with a brief dip in 2020.

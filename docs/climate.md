In September 2021 the Richmond City Council unanimously declared a [Climate and Ecological Emergency][climate emergency], committing the city to proactively address the city's greenhouse gas pollution and remedy historical inequities that disproportionately put black and low income communities at greater risk.

Richmond Gas Works, a utility dedicated to the distribution of methane, an incredibly potent greehouse gas pollutant, should play a major role in reducing the city's emissions. Unfortunately, its behavior has not changed and the city's associated climate pollution continues to grow.

Methane traps around 85 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20 year period, making gas leaks a huge threat to our climate goals. It's so potent that scientists have estimated that total system leaks of more than 3.2% make methane worse for the climate than a coal power plant. This isn't just the leaks in the pipes, this also includes leaks from the well heads, transmission pipes, compressor stations, and behind the meter, such as at your gas stove. Leaks in the distribution system close to or greater than 3.2% mean are disastrous for the climate.

Unfortunately, the LUF shows loss rates much greater than 3.2%, reaching an all-time high in 2022 of 9.1%.

Since 2012 the city has lost 8,631,648 Mcf of gas, equivalent to **3,482,248,068 metric tons of CO2** if all of this ended up as leaks. The warming potential of is enormous. It would be the equivalent of adding more than 757,000 internal combustion engine cars to the roads for a year. Or more than 3/4 of the emissions from a large coal burning power plant right in the middle of the city. And that's just from the lost gas. There are additional enormous emissions from all the gas that makes it to our homes and businesses that we burn for heating our homes and water. 

And it's not just the leaks and lost gas. Records show that every year the city pays tens or hundreds of thousands each year to organizations actively working to stop or delay action on climate. In many ways, the city is funding the opposition to the city's own goals as declared in the Climate and Ecological Emergency declaration.

Since 2012 the city has given **over $1 million to these climate denying organizations**.

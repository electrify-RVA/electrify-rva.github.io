Let's examine Richmond Gas Works by the numbers.



## Customers and sales
Richmond Gas Works (RGW) is a local distribution gas utility wholly owned and operated by the city of Richmond, VA. There are five types of customers that a local distribution gas utility such as Richmond Gas Works can have: residential (households), commercial (businesses), industrial (manufacturers), electric (electric utilities who use methane gas to create electricity), and vehicle fuel (for large vehicles that run on methane gas, such as waste trucks or city busses). As you can see *most* of the customers for RGW are residential. Go ahead and zoom in or click on **Residential** and **Commercial** to deselect those groups and you can see that there are a handful of Industrial (355 in 2022) and Vehicle Fuel (4 in 2022) customers that are hard to see otherwise. (Click again to have those types reappear.)

Typically, a gas utility will sell gas to customers (pretty obvious) and the price includes the cost of gas itself as well as the cost of all the pipes to move the gas around. Large customers (typically industrial) can pay to have the utility transport gas that they purchased elsewhere, paying to use the pipelines and not the cost of gas itself. This is a small portion of what RGW does, so let's focus on gas sales. 

We can see that **Residential** customers make up a much smaller fraction of gas sales than customers, and **Industrial** users now make up almost half of gas sold.

While Industrial and Commercial users have some ability to negotiate better prices, they also have better access to capital if they ever wanted to transition off fossil fuels. This is less true of **Residential** customers, so let's focus on them.

The chart below shows that RGW has steadily added **Residential** customers over the past 25+ years, growing from fewer than 80,000 customers in 1997 to more than 110,000 today, a 36% increase since 2000.

While it may have been hard to see in the sales chart above, **Residential** sales have fallen over the same period, dropping by almost 1 million Mcf since 2000. (An Mcf is a thousand cubic feet of gas.) Residential sales are highly tied to the climate and weather as most gas goes towards space heating and water heating, which is why some years have more or less sales (cold weather means more heating and more gas sales).

With more customers and less gas sold, this means the average residential customer is using less and less gas, which we can see below. Average residential gas sales have plummetted by 36% since 2000.

While this is good for the climate that people are using less gas on average, it is not good that more and more households are getting hooked up to a fossil fuel distribution system. It is also a _financially risky_ situation for Richmond Gas Works.

Let's examine why.

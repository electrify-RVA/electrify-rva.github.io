## Explosions are happening alarmingly often

Richmond Gas Works’ leaks are exposing us and our families to injury or even death. It’s only a matter of time before Richmond experiences a building explosion caused by gas. It risked one [in 2023!](https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-gas-leak-update-may-10-2023) Localities around the United States regularly appear in national news after experiencing their own explosion: a [home explosion](https://nypost.com/2024/02/17/us-news/firefighter-killed-11-injured-in-virginia-home-explosion/) Sterling, Virginia which killed one firefighter and injured 11 other people on February 17th, 2024; a [building explosion](https://www.yahoo.com/news/gas-explosion-brings-down-building-152353150.html) in Washington, DC on January 18th, 2024, a [hotel explosion](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/explosion-at-downtown-fort-worth-hotel-injuries-21-natural-gas-leak-suspected/ar-AA1mEWDC) which injured 21 people in Fort Worth, Texas on January 9th, 2024, and NFL player Caleb Farley’s [home exploded](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/explosion-home-titans-caleb-farley-caused-natural-gas-investigators-say) on August 28th, 2023 and killed his father.

Explosions are caused by gas leaks, of which Richmond has nearly a thousand. We have thousands of miles of pipes, and not enough staff to maintain them without leaking. As Richmond continues [expanding its gas infrastructure](./cost.md), the problem becomes more severe. The simple truth is that gas leaks, and leaked gas can ignite or explode. Richmond City Council and the Mayor should prioritize retiring our gas utility, and along with it the risk of leaks and explosions.

## Gas is poisoning the air in your home and workplace

Gas leaking into your home or workplace is exposing you and your loved ones to toxic, carcinogenic chemicals like [benzene](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/climate/natural-gas-home-toxic-chemicals.html). Benzene naturally occurs in gas, and experts claim that there is no safe exposure level to benzene. Long-term exposure can increase the likelihood of blood disorders and cancers like leukemia. Even when your gas appliances are turned off, they could still be leaking toxic gasses like benzene into your home. A study in California states that [three-quarters](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/climate/gas-stoves-methane-emissions.html) of the pollution from a gas stove occurred when it was turned off. 

When it’s not leaking, burning gas with a stove or a furnace in your home risks you and your family developing chronic diseases like asthma. Burned gas produces indoor air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, which children are especially vulnerable to. One study found that [12.7%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9819315/) of all childhood asthma cases could have been caused by gas stoves. Asthma causing gas pollution makes Richmond especially hard to live in since it’s the [third worst](https://aafa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/aafa-2021-asthma-capitals-report.pdf) place in the nation to live with asthma. 

Protecting the health of ourselves and our loved ones requires that toxic gas appliances are slowly phased out of our homes.

## Leaked gas is boiling the planet

Continuing our dependence on natural gas is boiling our communities alive and stealing the future of young people away from them. Natural gas consists mostly of the chemical methane, one of the most dangerous climate pollutants. Climate pollutants leaked into the air trap dangerous levels of heat in our communities, make storms like [Hurricane Gaston](https://www.wric.com/news/hurricane-gaston-remembering-the-destruction-15-years-later/) more likely, severe, damaging, and expensive. 

The common claim that gas is cleaner than alternative fuels like coal is a lie. It fails to account for gas leaked on every stop to your home. According to a 2023 study, leaking more than [4,7%](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace3db) of the gas is dirtier than burning coal. The [Richmond Times Dispatch reported](https://richmond.com/news/local/climate-richmond-gas-methane-leaks/article_3e47a766-f0c8-11ed-8262-236e52f13eac.html) that Richmond Gas Works lost 14% of its gas in January 2022, making gas far dirtier than burning coal during that time.

title: We found a toxic gas leak in your neighborhood
---

And Richmond is failing to act despite the possibility of explosion. Many leaks are located near homes, schools, 
businesses, and parks. Richmond Gas Works, owned a run by the city, maintains a network of severely leaking gas pipes 
under neighborhoods throughout the city and counties. Some pipes are 100 years old. Hundreds of miles of 
pipes are decayed and leaking, and nearly a thousand gas leaks require fixes by Richmond's Department of Public 
Utilities. Dozens of these leaks are liable to ignite or explode. 

`INSERT LEAK MAP`

Unfortunately leaks just scratch the surface of Richmond's methane problem. They are not only able to 
[explode][Explosive], but they also waste gas which customers pay for. The expansive network of leaky pipes 
in Richmond could potentially cost [several hundred million dollars][pipeline] to replace, which customers will pay for. 
The tough financial position Richmond's gas utility is in requires that we think outside the box to protect residents 
and small businesses. 

Fortnately, Richmond doesn't have to keep doing this. We can move beyond methane.

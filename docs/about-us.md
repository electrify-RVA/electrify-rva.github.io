*Beyond Methane RVA* is a community led campaign of volunteers that focuses on the Richmond Gas Works, our municipal gas utility. Our work seeks to broaden public awareness of the health, safety, and economic impacts of Richmond Gas Works. Beyond Methane RVA consists of a myriad of environmental groups and individuals alike. 

Members of our organization donate their time and expertise to this campaign as volunteers. With our collective efforts we hope to expedite affordable clean energy expansion and phase out of dirty natural gas. We believe that transitioning Richmond's gas utility towards clean energy sources is the only financially viable and environmentally sound solution to Richmond's Methane Problem. 

Our leak mapping project was made possible with a generous grant from the Sierra Club, which we used to purchase the methane sensors that we use in the field. The University of Richmond's Geospacial Analysis Lab was pivotal in helping us map our work.

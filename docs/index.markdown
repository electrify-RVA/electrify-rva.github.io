title: We found a gas leak in your neighborhood
---

Richmond Gas Works is a municipal gas utility owned and operated by Richmond City. It services Richmond, Henrico,
Chesterfield, and Hanover. Beyond Methane RVA is a group of local, unpaid advocates seeking to raise awareness about the 
dangers of Richmond's gas utility. 

Richmond maintains a network of severely leaking gas pipes that permeate neighborhoods throughout the city and counties.
Some pipes are 100 years old. Hundreds of miles of pipes are decayed and leaking, and nearly a thousand gas leaks 
require remediation by Richmond's Department of Public Utilities. Those leaks are located near homes, schools, 
businesses, and parks. 

`INSERT LEAK MAP`

Unfortunately leaks just scratch the surface of Richmond's methane problem. They are not only sometimes 
[explosive][Explosive], but they also waste gas which customers pay for. Also, the expansive network of leaky pipes 
in Richmond could potentially cost [several hundred million dollars][pipeline] to replace and drastically raise prices for 
customers. The tough financial position Richmond's gas utility is in necessitates that we think outside the box
to protect residents and small businesses. 

It's time to move beyond methane.

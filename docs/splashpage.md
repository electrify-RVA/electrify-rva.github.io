Checked out your gas bill lately? You've probably noticed it's been growing. Part of that is the price of natural gas, which goes up when there's a war (like in Ukraine) or an explosion in a supply line (Nord Stream). But look a little closer at your bill and you'll see you're not just paying for gas. You're paying for pipes -- Richmond Gas Works pipes that lie under your street and belong to the city.

So why are you paying for pipes?

It makes sense on one hand: those pipes get the gas into your home, so kicking in a little for repair and maintenance seems reasonable.  But what if those pipes were in Henrico County, or Goochland? You may not live there, but you're paying for those pipes too. Why? Because existing customers pay to connect new customers. Here's how it works:

RGW can't control the price of gas, but they can control how many customers they have. More customers equals more income, so RGW wants more customers. To get more customers they need to run more gas lines, and that's just what they're doing. You can see those costs of expansion right there on your gas bill inside "Volume Charge".

That's not all. You're not just paying for brand new pipes that deliver gas beyond Richmond. You're paying for gas that NO ONE gets. It's leaked into thin air. Right now, RGW has more than 900 known gas leaks from pipes all over Richmond and beyond. Some of these leaks cross the lower explosive limit, which means if there's a source of ignition nearby it could explode, and we've already had a lot of close calls. The cost of that leaked gas is right there in your home, on your gas bill.

Of course, there's a lot more to this story. There's also a lot of good data to back it up.
